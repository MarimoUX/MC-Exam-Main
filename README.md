## Features

- Timer Functionality: A countdown timer that can be set according to the exam duration.
- Randomized Questions and Options: Each exam instance presents questions and their options in a random order.
- Scoring System: Automatically calculates scores based on responses.

## Usage

### Educational and Personal Use

This project is intended for educational and personal use. It is a foundational tool for creating practice multiple-choice exams and is not ready for deployment as-is.

### Important Security Note

This template lacks server-side security measures and should not be used in real exam situations. If you plan to use this project in a production or exam environment, ensure to implement appropriate security measures.

### Customization

The project includes placeholder questions. To create your own multiple-choice exam, modify the `questions` constant in the script with your set of questions.
